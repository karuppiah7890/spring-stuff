# Story

I'm trying to understand Spring Integrations. The sample
application that I want to try is - integrating with an
SFTP server which has some files, for example XML files,
which I need to pull and process (parse, process etc) and
maybe even map it into another object dynamically and then
call another service with it or maybe just log it for now.
So, with this aim, I'm going to try out stuff!

While bootstrapping the project, I missed adding the
Spring Integration dependencies ðŸ˜… I think it's these
two - one for source code and another for test code

```groovy
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-integration'
testImplementation 'org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-test'
```

I need to add these two and then I would be good to go
I think! :)

I'm gonna start by upgrading the Gradle version to 6.7.1
